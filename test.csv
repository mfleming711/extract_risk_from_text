Freehold Regional High School District,,,Mike was looking for an old threat assessment that they had opened. I looked and was unable to find anything so I asked support and they couldn't find it so they sent it over to development. Development said from what they could see there was never a case opened for that student within our system. 
"Immacolata School - Richmond Heights, MO",MO,,Tom had some guardians that needed to be deleted and others that needed to be added into the system. Said they sent out a test email notification and a former parent received it so wanted to make sure they are removed so they no longer have children at the school 
Ste. Genevieve School District R-2 ,,,Had a call with Jason about integrations. Candias was on the call. After chatting about the integration Gatekeeper came up and Jason and I chatted about Gatekeeper being an option for them as opposed to doing the integration. He said the December cut off for the discount may be too soon for him to get any decisions made but told me to reach out to him in January about setting up a demo and he is going to talk to his team. He said there are things they do like about IdentAKid and would love to see if we can do those things. One thing he mentioned was kids coming in late and I said that was something we could track with Gatekeeper.
Rochester City School District,NY,,"Charles wanted to get 3 additional users added. We had sent over a renewal but he said that he is not able to sign a quote and that could throw a big wrench into them being able to move forward. Sara spoke to him to clarify what the issue was on their side. After speaking with him we ended up just creating a quote and closing it out as Closed Won without a signature and had Lisa send an invoice. He said if they had to sign a contract it could take 2+ years as that is what has happened in the past so we obviously did not want to have to do that because we want to keep them on and get the upsell. And from what it looks like on the deals already in HS none of those quotes have been signed either in the past few years. Also, Nicole reached out to ask who should be the contact at CrisisGo to receive their compliance documents. Emailed Chris & Lisa to see how I should handle it. "
Virginia Episcopal School,,,Michelle reached out about getting access to iControl so I get her set up so she had permissions for it and then she asked about setting up gateway alerts and battery life alerts. Told her I would let her know once those were available and then opened a support ticket for her once those were available. 
John Burroughs School,,,Had a Gatekeeper Demo with Sarah & Matt. I kicked off the call with an intro and told Andy they wanted to see a brief overview to get an idea of what is can do. They do not currently use anything other than paper and pencil. Jumped in a few times to answer questions and then closed out the call at the end. Definitely seemed like they were interested in the product. Matt came in late to the meeting so they said they were going to watch the recording together and they would let me know their thoughts. 
School Of The Osage,,,"Working with Dave regarding their Gatekeeper quote. Trying to get info on what exact hardware they have. I sent over quote just so he can have an idea on pricing. Told him that if they do decide they would like to do a 3 year deal instead just let me know and I can change it. He said they do have some hardware from using Raptor but he just knew it was an id card reader, printers, and ipads but needs to find out model and brand so we can check and see if it will be compatible with our system. "
St. Georgeâ€™s Episcopal School - LA,LA,,"Spoke with Caroline. She didn't feel like she was being heard by support over an issue they were having and just wanted to talk it through with someone. So we chatted about it and she told me the issue. Sara and I looked into the support tickets and it looks like they are working on it and it has been escalated to engineering. Basically the issue was that one of the teachers was not receiving lockdown alerts. They were recieving other alerts but just not lockdown. They even did a test of it, ran one alert, closed it and then ran another and it still wasn't coming through. May be an apple watch thing or may be a deeper issue. I told her I will keep an eye on it and if it doesn't get resolved this week then myself, caroline, sara and support can get on a call and talk through the issue to make sure it gets resolved. "
Miss Porters School ,CT,,"Courtney and I chatted quite a bit about my trip to Scotland. She was asking a bunch of questions because she went to Scotland in college and said after seeing all my instagram stories about my trip she really wants to go back. She had some questions about reunification. She is now digging in and wanted to know if it is all set or if there was anything I needed to do on our end to set it up. I told her she should be all set to go. Also, let her know about the reunification kits so once she has it all figured out if they wanted to do a real practice that is available. She said that may be a couple months down the line but said she loves there is an option for a kit and that may be something they are interested in. "
Presbyterian Christian School,MS,,Brandon was wondering if there was a way to do practice drills and play around without sending notifications to everyone. I went into their console and there was a district training group with just him and one other person. Told him if he uses that him and Kevin will be the only people who receive it. He said that he forgot and accidentally released an alert a few days after and it sent out the sound and teachers were in training and it interrupted that and he obviously doesn't want to do that. So told him to use that training group and he should be all set to go. 
Cardinal Ritter College Preparatory High School,MO,,Brandon emailed back after I checked in with them to see how the roll out was going and he said he had tried to log in using one of the teachers log in info and was getting an error message saying it didn't exist. I asked him who the teacher was and what the error message said so he sent me some screen shots. From the screenshots it looked like he may be trying to use the teachers login info to get into the console not the app. And that is exactly what it was. So I reiterated that the console is for admins and of course a teacher could be added as an admin if they would like but if they only want the teacher to be able to send and receive alerts and not do any management or configuration then he would only want them to be able to log into the app. 
St. Bridget of Kildare School - Pacific,MO,,Mike is working on their rosters and was having some issues. Sent him over the roster guide and reminded him how to log into the console. He said his IT person has been out the last couple of days but once she is back in the two of them are going to sit down together and get it figured out. Told him that if they need help to let me know and hopefully I can help with a quick fix but if not that I can always connect them with the support team to get it all squared away. Renee the IT Director also emailed and said that the last principal tried to explain it to her but something got lost in translation so it was a fiasco. So she said she is just going to start over and read the instructions from our guide and go from there because she thinks that will be the easiest way to do it. 
St. Francis Borgia Grade School,MO,,Lou is working on setting up the roster sync through FACTS said it has been cumbersome which when I originally spoke to him a couple months ago about it I told him that they didn't have a direct sync and that it would have to be done through GG4L and that FACTS charges for the sync. He reached out recently and said he got the API info from FACTS and is working on seeing if he can make it work. He now is asking if we can do an LDAP or Google Workspace sync because it has been taking him so long to figure out the direct sync. I told him that I checked with support and they said that is not available. 
Holy Trinity School Georgetown,,,New customer in tranisition. Was on a call with Tiffany and Chris on 12/13 & 12/16. Basically went over with Chris what I will be here for once Tiffany hands the account over to me. Chatted about setting up another call for mid january to chat before he does the full training for teachers and staff. That way if he has any questions on Train the Trainer or anything else we can get those answered before he does that training. 
Cold Spring School,CT,,Called to wish Carrie a happy holidays and see if there were any questions or anything I can help with before the holidays as they just finished onboarding 2 weeks ago. Said they are having issues with the roster. Told her to send an email to support but include me in it. She said any time they reach out to support she will include me to keep me in the loop. She said that the onboarding process has not been great because they were told things during the sales process that did not end up being true. They wanted to do a sync with their SIS and were told they could but it turns out they can't. So she said it has just been a lot more work than they wanted it to be but she is hoping once they get all the roster stuff straightened out they will be good to go from there.

St. Catherine Laboure School - Saint Louis,MO,,"Called to wish Stephanie a Happy Holidays. She said some of her staff and teachers are still struggling with the rostering and she would like to set up a training in person if possible. Told her there is a cost to that and she said that is fine and she is willing to pay for it because she just thinks it will be much more helpful to have someone there in person to answer questions and walk staff through everything. She is going to send me a list of a few other things that she needs taken care of. Also, i told her about how staff and teachers can send in feedback and she said that is super helpful she will have them do that because some didnt receive alerts. "
St. John's-Ravenscourt School,Canada,,Called to wish Odain Happy Holidays and to check in to make sure everything got resolved with the SMS unsubscribe that he was working with support on.

St. Dominic High School,MO,,Called Melissa to wish her happy holidays. She said things are going good. The only issue they have is that he nurse does not receive her alerts on CrisisGo but that is an issue with where she is in the building. She is basically in a cement box in the basement. Once she steps out of her office she receives the alert. She also receives email alerts so she said that helps and also they all have walkie talkies so when an alert does go off the admins are immediately talking on them and she gets the info that way. she said its not a huge deal and they have looked into getting a booster but that didn't work either so they are doing what they can and as said before it hasn't been a major issue.
All Saints School - Saint Peters,MO,,Called to wish Melvin Happy Holidays. Said he is still working on getting through the training toolkit and learning about CG. They will be having a professional development day on 1/17/25 with teachers and they will be going over CG on that day. I set a task to reach out a couple days after to see if they ran into any issues or if there are any questions that they may have.
Cape Girardeau School District #63,MO,, Called to wish Josh Happy Holidays. Said everything is good right now the only thing he needed help with was mute releasing a roster event and a few alerts because the middle school principal said he did it but it wasnt closed and josh said his ocd was driving him nuts because he likes those things to be clean and closed out. So I told him Im the same way and totally understood and closed it all out for him. 
St. Margaret Mary Alacoque School,MO,,Emailed Chris to check. They said that they would like a refresher training and want to set up a call to go over configuration.
